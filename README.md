### Game Introduction

This is the classic snake game. The user will click the play button to start the game. The snake's movement is controlled by the arrow keys. After each piece of food eaten the snake will grow. If the snake collides with the wall or itself it will die. The user will then need to click on the refresh button to start the game over.
